# Subgraph federation test (LOL typo in repo name...)

Small setup to figure out if TheGraph subgraphs (https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) work with Apollo Federation (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) to combine multiple subgraphs into one huge graphql endpoint.

to build the subgraphs run `npx graph codegen` and then `npx graph build`.

To deploy check your subgraph providers documentation.
